    <h1>The Sound and the Fury - William Faulkner</h1>
    <p>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, <br>
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, <br>
To the last syllable of recorded time; <br>
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools <br>
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! <br>
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, <br>
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, <br>
And then is heard no more. It is a tale <br>
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, <br>
Signifying nothing.
