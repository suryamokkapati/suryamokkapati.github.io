    <h1>Kid A - Radiohead</h1>
    <p>Personal favourite radiohead album out of pure spite. I said I liked it back when I didn't understand it and now I do and I maintain that In Rainbows is objectively better
        but you know what Kid A is still my favourite. Ok Computer is also good and arguably better but Kid A is still the best. <br> <br> Amnesiac is also something that I pretty objectively like more, 
        now that Let Down isn't underrated anymore, Life in a Glasshouse is the new underrated song.
