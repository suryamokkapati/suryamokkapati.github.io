    <h1>The Sound and the Fury - William Faulkner</h1>
    <p> <i> "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, <br>
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, <br>
    To the last syllable of recorded time; <br>
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools <br>
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! <br>
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, <br>
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, <br>
    And then is heard no more. <b>It is a tale <br>
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</b> <br>
    Signifying nothing"  - Lord Macbeth </i>

    </p>
    <p>
    This page includes what you will need to know in order to read Faulkner's magnum opus, The Sound and the Fury. <br> One of the most abandoned pieces of classic literature, and for good reason. A bastion of stream-of-consciousness writing,<br> Faulkner constantly jumps from past <br> to present to future like a [literal] idiot.  <br> <br> I am not making this out of charity, but rather for my own peace of mind as I read. <br> <br> You should be warned that reading this will give you "spoilers" for parts
        of the book, however, the book is so out there <br> in time that it doesn't matter, the details of the moments, or the memory of the loss of them, is where the beauty truly can be found.
        <br>
        <br>
        The novel takes place in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County in Mississippi, one that you will have to be familiar with if you decide to study Faulkner. <br> The very picture of the Southern Gothic,
        the fictional county mirrors the decline of the Compsons  as well as that of the Old South. <br> <i> See bottom of the page for an interactive map of the county.</i> <br><br>

         <b> The Compsons</b> are a crumbling southern dynasty, a once slave-owning family struggling to maintain honor in the waning hours of its existence. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Jason III: The head of the Compson family, he is dead in 1912. Husband to Caroline. <br> <br>
        Caroline: Hypochondriac self-absorbed loser of a woman who is wife to Jason III. Can't care for herself, can't care for her kids, but acts like she does. <br>
        <br>
        Benjy: An "idiot," severely mentally stunted, youngest of the Compson children. Gelded (castrated) in 1912, name was changed from Maury to Benjamin in 1900 when he was found to be mentally incompetent. <br> His section is the most challenging, and has stream-of-consciousness structure and jumps between the past and present at will.<br> <br>
        Jason IV: Pathetic loser who siphons money by extorting his sister. Cynical and petty, he is the second youngest Compson. Quite symbolically significant, left out of the glory of the South, trying to be a part of his family's legacy but can't. <br><br> 
        Candace (Caddy): Only daughter and second oldest Compson child. Promiscuous and rebellious, the Holden Caulfield of the South. Very close with Quentin, who sees her as a vulnerable proxy for the family honor. Ends up getting pregnant out of wedlock. <br><br>
        Quentin: Smart, sensitive, and possibly more mentally incompetent than Benjy. The oldest Compson child worships his sister as a symbol of purity in the family, of the family. Gets weird when he turns all incestuous and kills himself with a cheap imitation <br> of Jeff Buckley in the Charles River two months after his sister gets married.
