    <h1>The Sound and the Fury - William Faulkner</h1>
    <p> <i> "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, <br>
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, <br>
    To the last syllable of recorded time; <br>
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools <br>
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! <br>
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, <br>
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, <br>
    And then is heard no more. It is a tale <br>
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, <br>
    Signifying nothing" </i> - Lord Macbeth

    This page includes what you will need to know in order to read Faulkner's magnum opus, The Sound and the Fury. <br> One of the most abandoned pieces of classic literature, and it is easy to see why. While reading this novel you will <br> encounter some of the 
        most wack stream-of-consciousness writing out there, with Faulkner jumping from <br> past to present to future like a [literal] idiot. However, if you complete it, you will be rewarded.

        The novel takes place in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County in Mississippi, one that you will have to be familiar with if you decide to study Faulkner. <br> The very picture of the Southern Gothic, the fictional county mirrors the decline of the Compsons <br> as well as the broader decay of the Old South

        <b>The Compsons:</b>
         <br>
         The Compsons are a crumbling southern dynasty, a once slave-owning family struggling to maintain honor in the waning hours of its existence.
