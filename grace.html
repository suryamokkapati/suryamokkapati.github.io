    <h1>Grace - Jeff Buckley</h1>
    <p>Very good for what it was. Lots of loud noise and a very mature intuition from Buckley about phrasing and highs/lows. Very impressive how his voice became an instrument, especially with the shrill whin screams he does. <br> The dissonance in So Real was interesting, drew me in. Not a huge fan of his cover of Hallelujah, still partial to Leonard Cohen. My interpretation is Buckley's Hallelujah is angsty and young, and Cohen's is a more mature melancholy, and I can live with that. <br> I could live without some songs on the album like Dream Brother, but oh well. Corpus Christi Carol was one of my favorites, it is a middle english hymn and was very soothing on the ears, like Lilac Wine. I liked the Nina Simone one more, but still, it was moving. Moving is the paradigm of this album, the ending to Forget Her where he starts screaming about what a fool he's been is incredibly moving, as is the peak of Lover, You Should've Come Over, and even Grace. Last Goodbye is underrated. Rest in peace Jeff Buckley, these are some good songs though.<br> <br>
        Ranking of songs from worst to best: <br> 
        Eternal Life > Dream Brother > Mojo Pin > Hallelujah > Grace > Lilac Wine > Last Goodbye > Lover, You Should've Come Over > So Real > Forget Her</p>
