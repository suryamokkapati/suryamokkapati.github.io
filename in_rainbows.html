    <h1>In Rainbows - Radiohead</h1>
    <p>This album was the first "real" Radiohead that I listened to. I'd heard Creep like any other person, but early in high school my friend Will sent me Jigsaw Falling Into Place and said it was peak.
        <br>
            I didn't agree with him and even though I mildly enjoyed it, I told him it was hot garbage. 
        <br> <br>
            At some point I listened to Nude, and I can still vividly remember how blown away I was when that "Oooh" section began at the end. I still get knocked out of my socks when I hear it.
        <br> <br>
            More recently as I am now a well-versed radiohead  listener, Reckoner blows me away, during the section near the end where the backing vocals say "In Rainbows." I highly recommend listening to the Backing Vocals track that can be found on youtube. 
        <br> The full album is undoubtedly a 10/10. There is no weak track on it, and though it isn't my favorite Radiohead album, I cannot deny that it is perfect. Weird Fishes / Arpeggi is still one of my favourite songs to play on the guitar. 
        <br> <br>
            Interestingly enough, while Videotape is one of my favourite tracks, I heard that Thom Yorke hated it and cried in the studio when they played it because they stripped down the full band version to just the piano and his vocals, though I prefer its rawness.
